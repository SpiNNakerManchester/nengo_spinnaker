Code for SpiNNaker executables
==============================

The SpiNNaker executables require `spinnaker_tools` v1.3.3 as released by Steve
Temple to build.  If this is available then, after sourcing the `setup` file in
the `spinnaker_tools` directory and making `sark` and `spin1_api` the Nengo
executables may be built by calling `make` in this directory.
